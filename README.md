# My Online Digital Portfolio

**Greetings, Traveller, and Welcome!**

Here you'll find various projects using a range of technologies that I've worked on over the years.  It's a showcase of my skills, learnings and experience.

**NOTE:**  Some of my repositories don't have a license yet.  Please adopt a ["look but don't use"](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) approach with them for the time being (you might come across things that are copyrighted by a third party and used with permission &ndash; I cannot extend that permission to you).  I will add licenses or copyright notices to all of my public repositories in the near future.

In more-or-less reverse order of chronology:

## [ExtrAdeept](https://github.com/kwoodman1970/ExtrAdeept/) (Python)

This is my current project.  It's a Python library for controlling [Adeept's](https://www.adeept.com/) [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)-based [robot kits](http://www.adeept.com/c/robotics_0416/).  The goal is to have a library of classes for creating objects that interact with the components (e.g. motors, lights and sensors) that are connected to the [HAT](https://www.adeept.com/search/?&Keyword=hat&Price=20-40), and to be able to create an object for the machine that's formed by such components (e.g. an articulating arm, a car or a tank).

## [InceptionU-Project3a](https://github.com/kwoodman1970/InceptionU-Project3a) (React, JavaScript)

For Project 3 at [InceptionU](https://www.inceptionu.com/), we were to work on real-world web applications for real-world clients.  Extra credit was given for using [React components](https://react.dev/learn), user authentication, having a second application for administrators, and a number of other things.

We had the privilege of working on [PAWSitive PetStarz](https://www.petstarz.ca/) &ndash; a web application for helping pet adopters connect with ethicial, humane pet suppliers.  We were given a codebase that had been built by a team of students at [SAIT](https://www.sait.ca/), and our primary task was to create a set of forms for letting pet suppliers input their pets and associated records into the application.

This repository does *not* contain the complete application &ndash; it's just a small subset and it only contains the files that we worked on.  You *can* see the fruits of our labours in our [demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aLnxrPMmDY), though.

## [InceptionU-Project2](https://github.com/kwoodman1970/InceptionU-Project2) (React, JavaScript)

For Project 2 at [InceptionU](https://www.inceptionu.com/), we were to make a full stack app that addresses a unique challenge or problem.  Extra credit was given for implementing full [CRUD functionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete), having more than one or two pages, using a document-style database (like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)), [React](https://react.dev/) with a context API, and a number of other things.

Our submission was an application for individuals to invite their friends to join in pop-up, ad-hoc phyiscal activites around the city.  We used [React](https://react.dev/) with a context for userID and stored data in JSON files that are saved when the server receives a SIGINT (Ctrl-C) signal.

We didn't get as far with this project as we would've liked, but that's okay &ndash; for us, the true goal of this project was to learn.

## [InceptionU-Project1](https://github.com/kwoodman1970/InceptionU-Project1) (JavaScript)

For Project 1 at [InceptionU](https://www.inceptionu.com/), we were to make a backend-only system that would respond to HTTP GET requests (e.g. through [cURL](https://curl.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)).  Extra credit was given for supporting additional HTTP request types, using persistant storage and creating an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification.

My submission was a proof-of-concept of how mentors and protégés can connect.  It implements full [CRUD functionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) for individuals, requests for help and offers of help.  Data is stored in JSON files that are saved when the server receives a SIGINT (Ctrl-C) signal.

Everyone who attended the demo was *very* impressed!

## [BottledWaterGlowLamp](https://github.com/kwoodman1970/BottledWaterGlowLamp) (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

I started making this some time around 2016 as an exercise while I was self-learning how to make progressive web apps that can run unaltered universally on any mobile device. It uses the now-obsolete [appcache manifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_manifest_in_HTML5) method.

I was inspired to create this after seeing a similar app on an app store and saying to myself, "Cool!  I think I can do better."

## TRAIN Conference Websites (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

[\[Web Page View\]](https://kwoodman1970.github.io/TRAINConference/)<br />
[\[Repository View\]](https://github.com/kwoodman1970/TRAINConference/)

These are websites that I created as a volunteer for TRAIN Conference.  **They're highly primitive in appearance and implementation by today's standards,** but they complied with the standards & best practices of the day and demonstrate how my skills improved &amp; my experience increased year after year.

## [Platform]() (C/C++)

In the late 1990's, as I was nearing the end of my days as a university student, I was keenly interested in multi-platform software development but dismayed by the diversity of compiler macros that each C/C++ compiler manufacturer used.  This project's goal was to bring order to this chaos by implementing a common set of macros that would make multi-platform coding easier.

## [DataStructures](https://github.com/kwoodman1970/DataStructures) (C++)

In the mid 1990's, I was introduced to data structures for the first time in a post-secondary course that used Pascal (specifically, Turbo Pascal 5.5).  When I later returned to full-time university studies and learned C++, I immediately recognized the potential of implementing data structures as template classes.

*I have additional projects (e.g. VBA) that will be included in this portfolio in the near future.  Stay tuned!*
